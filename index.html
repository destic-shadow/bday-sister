      Dear sister, today you turn 25! You've been beside me through everything. Truly I couldn't wish for anything more in this world. You are a blessing given to me by Allah. I can't express how much I want to see you right now for your birthday. I have prepared this for you in a hurry I am not good with gifts as you know so take this as my gift. Today I dedicate this site to you and your birthday.
    </p>
